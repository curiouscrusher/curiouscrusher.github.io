                <p>I'm a Senior Developer and I specialize in front-end development and design of eCommerce websites. My daily responsibilities often include creating functional interfaces from design comps, QA’ing fellow developers code, interacting with clients, and assisting with training of Jr. Developers. My formal background in design is backed by 3+ years of front-end development, which has given me a wide range of experiences. Including, but not limited to Magento, Shopify Plus, and Wordpress, as well as various other platforms and development languages.</p>

                <p>I’ve worked in teams and led teams of developers, utilized tools like Gulp, Grunt, and Node to streamline development and build tasks, all while maintaining clean project repos with Git. I've also worked with Web and SQL database servers, including upkeep, provisioning, and maintenance, which has made me quite comfortable working in command line environments as well.</p>
