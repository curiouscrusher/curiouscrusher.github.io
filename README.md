## Overview
This site is powered by Jekyll running a customized flavour of the Forty theme. 

## Details & Setup
To get started install bundler & Jekyll if you don't already have them. Next run `bundle install`, and finally `jekyll serve` to compile assets and start a local server.

Optimized images can be found in `assets/images/`, any new images should be properly compressed before uploading. Modular `SASS` files live in `_sass/` and are compiled with Jekyll.
