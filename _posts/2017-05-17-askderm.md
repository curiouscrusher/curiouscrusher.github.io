				<p>Askderm is a cosmetics supply company that manages a number of sub-brands. My primary role in this project at Gauge was on the front-end development team, as well as consulting on Design &amp; UX throughout. As a member of the front-end team I worked with a group of up to 5 other developers to build out a modular front-end that was heavily widget based. When the project was ready for launch, we had created 29 stores all based on one Magento installation, utilizing different color variants and widgets of the multi-faceted theme.</p>
